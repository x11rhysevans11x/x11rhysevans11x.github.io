  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using what I remembered in I.T last year and took a few glances at the board to make sure I didn't make any silly mistakes. This was effective as I learnt independently and only used help from the board as and when needed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a way however not looking as much meant that I was slightly slower than I possibly could’ve been and it almost meant I wasn’t guaranteed to get the correct code every time I tried it, so I need to work on the balance between the board and memory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next I will balance the way I work better to maximise my production in the lesson and maybe get less homework due to this faster work speed. This will improve my learning as productivity is key in I.T lesson’s so that you keep up with everyone else in the class.</td>
