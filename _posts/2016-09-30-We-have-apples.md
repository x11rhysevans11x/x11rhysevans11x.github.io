We have apples

Today my partner and I finished the first project of hello world on the fuze box and moved onto we have apples. 

We have apples is basically making the fuze box do maths this maths is quite simple but it is quite impressive. Today our class were very fast in setting up so we got lots of time to work and get as much done as possible this was good but we may have started packing up a bit early so we didn't do as much work as possible but that was only because the week before we were quite poor at setting up and packing up also we were in a different room than usual which was in the art department rather than the I.T department.
