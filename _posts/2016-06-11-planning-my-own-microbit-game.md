Planning my own microbit game

This I.T lesson started with a room change, with us going from I.T2 to I.T1.This meant we were using the iMacs which was a very nice surprise!

Now to the important stuff I finished the remaining 3 tutorials on microbit, and then went on to help the other 2 in my group, Charlie and Rory, to build a plan/outline of our game we are going to make, this game is called labyrinth, a maze game with 3 levels varying in difficulty.

This was meant to be set for homework but as us 3 were very sufficient in our work we got it done before the end of the lesson.
