**more media **

During another one of my I.T lessons we did an exercise where the side of the room with the red painting meant disagree and the side with the blue board ment agree we were told things such as you think reality TV is unscripted (I was right on the side of the room with the red painting for that one.)  

then we watched a biggest loser tv show trailer (The biggest loser is where about twelve obese people go to a place where they train together so the don't die of obesity although did a mention the 500 grand prize? I think most of them take it as a game show rather than a workout.)
