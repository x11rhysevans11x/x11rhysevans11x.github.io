Buzzfeed quizzes

In my last IT lesson me and my classmates were tasked with creating a buzzfeed quiz. Buzzfeed is a website which consists of videos, blogs and of course all the different kinds of quizzes from what kind of dog are you to what Nandos sauce are you.

Before we began creating our quizzes we did a quiz made by a random person first, I did 'which Cars character are you?' You’ll refer to me as Lightning from now on. My buzzfeed quizzes topic is: ‘how sarcastic are you?’
