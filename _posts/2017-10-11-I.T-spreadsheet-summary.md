Spreadsheets summary 

Over the past 5 lessons we have been practicing using spreadsheets to create coded messages using the =VLOOKUP command and many others. This experience has been challenging so fire but has been a great learning experience.

The part I have found the most challenging was last lesson where we were putting the encrypted message into one cell and decrypting it from there. I had to watch the process be done multiple times and had a helping hand from my classmates but I got through and have realised a lot about the topic. 

The parts I found less challenging were when we were just encrypting the message as the code was much simpler and easier to understand.

So my targets are to practice with the commands and be able to work capably without the help of my classmates and as many glances at the board.
