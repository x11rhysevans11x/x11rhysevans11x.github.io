  <tr>
    <td>I read the instructions thoroughly, as Mr Keen told us to. This was effective as it ensured I did the work right and therefore I went fast enough to do the amount of  exercises I wanted to do. I did the same whilst I did the homework exercises as well When I did the homework I referred to the glossary or the hints.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Now I need to work on my coding ability so I can remember to make the computer do maths for example, as the further you go into the exercises the smaller the hints get and the instructions become more vague so you have to figure it out by yourself more often than in the earlier exercises.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will remember more of how to perform a function eg. making python answer a number equation. This will improve my learning as I will be able to go faster and then I will be able to get more work done and I can therefore learn more in the lesson and also in homework time</td>
