    <td>I learnt by concentrating and using my knowledge more, this was effective as I started to pay more attention to the manual. This helped as I was using the resource's I had been given to as much of an advantage to me as I could.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I need to work on thinking ahead and what will help me on the long run, such as on wednesdayâ€™s lesson I was not being fast at the task and my partner had to take more of a dominant role in certain periods of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change to work quicker in the main part of the lesson rather than getting into a rush at the last part of the lessons. This will improve my learning as I will get the majority of the work done earlier than getting it done right at the end of the lesson.</td>
