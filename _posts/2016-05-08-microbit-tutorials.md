Microbit tutorials

During the lesson this Wednesday we started off watching Mr Keen show us how to complete our homework he set us the previous week, this act took him 2 minutes whilst it took me about an hour or two to finish, he then sent us away to our desks and told us our task for the lesson. 

The task was to work through the tutorials on microbit with our partners me and my partner (charlie) completed 4 out of 6 of these tutorialsâ€¦

These tutorials all contained their own different challenges which had caused some fellow students to lose faith and not get as much work done as they would've liked to. We were then set our homework which was to spend 30 minutes on microbit on the tutorials again, we were told to do this assignment for 30 minutes.
