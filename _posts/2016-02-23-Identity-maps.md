Identity maps

during my last I.T lesson before half term we began to create identity maps these had to include:

-Where you live now and any places you have lived in     the past (if applicable)

- Your family

- Your hobbies and interests

- Your future goals regarding college studies and future career(s)

- The types of media you use, including any social media

- The types of media you will use in the future to accomplish your goals.

we finished our identity maps for homework.
