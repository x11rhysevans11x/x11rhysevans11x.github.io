The third of February

During my I.T lesson on the third of February we did quite a few things : we were given a set of 12 scenarios which we were meant  put in order as most serious to least serious, we did this in groups of 5. Some of the things were as serious as 'posts that they are going on holiday and the house is empty.' to as sillyas ‘a funny video of his/her cat.’ After doing this exercise we discussed our answers with the class. After our discussion we went into groups of 3 and made a document about ‘10 ways you should enjoy social media.’
