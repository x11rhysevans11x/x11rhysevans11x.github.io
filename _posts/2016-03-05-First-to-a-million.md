First to a million

During my last I.T lesson we viewed a chain of videos of a sister and brother who challenge each other as to who can get one million views on their my view channels and at the end of each video the viewer would make a choice such as when the sister asked 'will you help' you would click yes or no and it would send you to the video you chose at the end of the competition the contest got out of hand and all of them fell out.
