    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today I tried to do as much of my work by myself as possible and try not to ask other people for some help or advice. This helped as it meant I wasn't stuck on one thing and if I was stuck I would skip the exercise and come back to it, from all the exercises I had to skip I always came back to them and finished them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WHat limited my learning was that as I tried not ask people help and see if it helped or not was that sometimes I didnâ€™t ask for help when I needed it and therefore I was slower in some cases because of this. So I need to learn to know when and when not to ask for help from a teacher or a fellow classmate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So next time I will know when to ask for help and I will also know more about the topic I am on right now. This will improve my learning as I will be able to work faster and more precisely on future exercises therefore learning more and more about python and its various functions.</td>
