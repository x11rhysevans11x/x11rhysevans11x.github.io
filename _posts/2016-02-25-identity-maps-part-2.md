Identity maps part 2

After we brought in our identity maps we then went round giving comments on people's identity maps and whilst we were doing that people would comment on ours.

When I was creating my identity map I had to think about how I would design it and what colours and pictures I used overall I think it went very well.When I was sharing the map with others  I was a bit anxious as to how people would think of me after reading it. When commenting I didn't want to offend anyone or say something a bit too nice. I think I would rather of said my comment to them in person rather than writing it anonymously as then they would of understood me better. When I got all of my comments back I felt a mix of emotions joy,sadness and frustration joy as some said they loved it others just wrote half hearted things like 'good’ or ‘decent’ and I felt frustrated when people criticised me for things they didn’t bother to read!

When commenting on something in real life rather than a computer you have to be very careful as they can retaliate in real life but they can't really on computers.I think I could of been more descriptive about myself but I thought I did give a good outline of myself on my identity map.

Considering I only use text and email there is nothing I would change on these media's. Over the past few lessons I have changed my view on social media a bit as I have been shown it can take over your entire life if you aren’t careful.

The lesson of commenting has not changed my plan of using social media as my plan is to use it on rare occasions and to talk with friends.
