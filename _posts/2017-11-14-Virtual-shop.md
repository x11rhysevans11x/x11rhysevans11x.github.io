Virtual shop

During our last lesson we learnt how to create a virtual shop using the =VLOOKUP command as well as others. 

The lesson started with Mr Tansley calling us up to the front of the room and showing us his fully functioning version and then how to create our own. I found this difficult to follow at times as some of the code was complex at times but with the help of my peers I got through it and had a fully functioning shop.
