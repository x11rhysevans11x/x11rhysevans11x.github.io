Beginning to code my own game

During my I.T lesson we went straight onto the computers to crack on with our micro:bit games. After about 10 minutes Mr Keen stopped us to check on our homework assignments to make sure they were sufficient.

After this we had a longer spell trying to code our games my game ,which I was making with Charlie and Rory, took much effort to try and do we did this with little success I must say. Mr Keen then brought all of the class over to the board as he was quite fed up of some of us asking the same questions over and over, but also to help to solve some of our general problems in the group. By this I mean he showed us what some of the chunks did.

He then sent us away with the homework of doing half an hour on making our games and writing a blog post.
