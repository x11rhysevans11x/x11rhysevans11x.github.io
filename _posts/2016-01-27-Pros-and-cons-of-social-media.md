Pros and cons of social media

during my I.t lesson on the 27th of January we talked about pro's and con’s of social media pro’s being: contact to old friends, family and so on also there is the ability to recruit people for jobs but this is also a bad thing as bad people can employ others to do horrible things. con’s include cyber bullying, propaganda and grooming.
