  <tr>
    <td>Today was quite a struggle for me as I found this chapter quite confusing, but I read all the instructions and asked others for their ideas as well. This was effective as I got  the answer and only had to use the hint if I was really stuck, looking back at past work really enhanced my progress as well. </td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I found the exercises quite hard it obviously meant I was going to be slower than I usually worked on other exercises as there was more to think about and the answer wasn't as easy to come to. So I need to just work on my knowledge of python and therefore work quicker than how I did today. </td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will know more about how to code functions and I will work faster, but also accurately so I can have more to show for the lesson. This will improve my learning as I can move onto different exercises and learn more stuff about them. </td>
