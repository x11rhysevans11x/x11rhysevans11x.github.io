Prezi

During my I.T lesson Mr Keen introduced us to Prezi and showed us a video about it. Then he sent us to our computers to sign up and then Mr Keen showed us how to use Prezi and all of it's features.He then told us to go to our desk’s and muck about with Prezi.At the end of the lesson he showed us how a Prezi should be made and then set us our Easter Project which was to make a Prezi about certain topics in 'the history of computing’.
