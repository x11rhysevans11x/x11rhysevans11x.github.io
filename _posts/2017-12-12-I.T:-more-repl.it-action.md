I.T: MORE REPL.IT ACTION 

In my I.T lesson we did some work on repl.it. We learnt many things this lesson including the different types of loops (for and while) as well as counters and how they all function and what this function does, we learn did a worksheet in class providing a basic outline of the use of counters and loops.

As we neared the end of the lesson we were set a homework of doing another worksheet which tested our knowledge of where and when to use the different loops and how many times an action would loop with counters.
