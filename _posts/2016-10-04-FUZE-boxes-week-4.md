    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by paying attention to every single little detail on every single page in the manual. This strategy was effective as it meant I was always going to be a hundred percent correct or near enough. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With reading every single little part of the manual comes a flaw however and that meant I worked slower, I need to work on taking more responsible risks so that I work faster and I can trust myself more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will use my own knowledge more and think by myself a bit rather than using the manual all the time that therefore will help me learn more effectively and I will learn better for it and that will make my quality of work better.</td>
  </tr>
