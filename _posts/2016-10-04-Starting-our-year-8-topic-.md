Make sure I was practicing well and in an actual proper way. This means it was effective as I was getting through the work knowing I was correct  </td>

    <td>I was sometimes not sure about something and used the manual too much meaning 
That I worked slower and less effectively. I need to work on this as you need to get as much work done in lessons as possible.</td>

    <td>I will work faster and more effectively to get more done and get as much practice and work 
Done with the FUZE boxes as much as I possibly can. It will improve my learning as I will learn more, and at a faster speed.</td>
