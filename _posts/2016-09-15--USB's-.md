USB's 

Another fine tuesday afternoon in school and we are back in I.T with the Fuze boxes as our topic. We sat down for a couple of minutes and then, BANG! We started setting up the Fuze and this took us no more than 5 minutes. 

We then got together in our pairs and started coding on the Fuze boxes. We then encountered saving our work onto our USB sticks we brought in as part of our homework. A few individuals who I'd rather not name came with no USB stick meaning all their work would go to nothing but practice rather than actual work for the second week running.

Then before we knew it the end of the day was upon us, this came rather quickly and to the surprise of many of us; but I suppose it's true what they say time flies when youâ€™re having fun!
