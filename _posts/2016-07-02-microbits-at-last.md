Microbits at last

The micro:bits have came at last and they are awesome!

During this lesson we were setting up our micro:bits and Mr Keen showed us what literally every part does.

Then went on to actually using them by this I mean we compiled some code onto our micro:bits and played with what we compiled onto it we had very little time to do this as we had to move on to a new topic and that was uses for social media some of these were: sexting, pornography, staying in touch with friends and showing off.
