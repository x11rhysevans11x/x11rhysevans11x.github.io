  <tr>
    <td>With the exercises were we were just on the computer it was the same as always 1 reader of the manual and one typing the code this is always effective as it means we both learn. With flashing lights though it was a different story as we both had to pay very close attention to the picture's in the book to make sure the wires were in the correct places.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As the pictures were quite small in the booklet even when the image was zoomed in on it was quite hard to see where to plug the wires in. So I really need to work on concentration as I needed complete focus this also goes for putting the wires in as you need a steady hand.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With the flashing the lights I kept thinking I was going wrong but what I need to do is test it before assuming it so that I can know for sure that I am either right or wrong and if I am wrong I need to think hard to try and find the solution to what the problem is.</td>
