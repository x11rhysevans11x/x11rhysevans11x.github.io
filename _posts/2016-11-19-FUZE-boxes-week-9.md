    <td>In lesson my partner and I were getting through the exercises quickly as we were using a no fuss strategy and it worked well as we did it rough and then went back through and cleaned up the errors. In my changes of my blog I was using w3schools tutorials to add code to my blog it was sometimes successful but sometimes not eg. I am going to ask a friend or a teacher how to add containers to my blog as i don't see it on w3schools.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>With my ability to code not being great my  reliance on w3schools was basically how I added to my blogâ€™s code, so I want to learn to become better at coding so that I have more knowledge about what I am adding into my blog so I will learn better.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will use the help of friends and expertise of teachers to help me make my blog look better than ever so that i can really push my grade up that bit more so that it is around 6 or 7 out of 9 rather than the 4 or 5 it probably is now. I will also be more resilient when using the FUZE boxes in lesson. </td>
