    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I used my own initiative as well as my partner and  I and my partner did half the lesson each reading and typing. This was effective as it made sure we did the same amount of work so we both learnt the same amount.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I forgot to do some parts of the book so we had to go back and that slowed us down. So that means I need to work on paying attention to the booklet more but not too much however as that would slow me down also.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be more careful when working and use the booklet for help when necessary rather than just using my own knowledge and also don't use it all the time as that will slow me down too much. I will improve my learning via that as I will work at a good speed to be fast but know I will get it right. </td>
