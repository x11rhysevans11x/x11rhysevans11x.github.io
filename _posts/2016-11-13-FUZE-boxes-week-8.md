    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using websites on the web such as w3schools to find colour schemes and tutorials on how to add stuff into my github pages. This was effective as I was using other resources than just those that were in the classroom and in my knowledge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>However sometimes I would be lazy with adding the things in; ie. sometimes i would have one too many spaces or too many semicolons, this meant I would spend too much time looking for the answer for the problem whereas if I had been more careful nothing would've happened.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be more careful and less lazy when searching for an answer or coding and will instead focus more and be less reluctant when typing/ copying things into the code of my blogging website so that I will work quicker.</td>
  </tr>
