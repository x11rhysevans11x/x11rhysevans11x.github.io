  <tr>
    <td>.I made sure that We read all of the script so that we didn't save half finished work and instead saved the finished exercise. This was effective as it made it so we didn’t have to do the work twice and get less work done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My  complete focus on getting it right slowed me down as we were going slower to make sure the work was completely correct. So as a result of this I need work on being faster and taking more risks on my work to get more of it done</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work faster to get more work done so that I am less rushed near the end of the lesson. This will improve my learning as I will get more work done and then have a good amount of time to pack up and finish so that I won’t slow other people down.</td>
