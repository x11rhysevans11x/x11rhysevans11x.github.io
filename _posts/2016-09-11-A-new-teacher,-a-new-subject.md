A new teacher, a new subject!

In my first I.T lesson of year 8 it was rather hectic but I learnt a lot of new things the first thing I learnt was my new teacher's name,  Mr. Ampah-Korsah, we logged into the computers and signed into the new year 8 google classroom.

 We were then introduced to our new topic for the year, making programming on a device called a Fuze box, we had to set these up which took some longer than others to say the least me and my partner, James were quite fast but not the first to set up. We then got onto just practicing the basics of the Fuze boxes it was rather confusing for me and James but it certainly was very good practice for what is to come!
