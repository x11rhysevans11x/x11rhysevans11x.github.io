    <th>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the manual closely and going back through it in some cases to try and figure out how to get past problems or to understand what I was typing better. This was effective as I learnt more out of less pages of the manual to maximise my learning and knowledge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I still struggle to understand the pictures that show were the wires go in the breadboard as it is so small but I need to get used to it so I can do the work. So I need to work on my focus and sometimes if I can't see it in the pictures work out the answer methodically.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to get to grips with how the photos work and I need to understand the whole wires thing so I sometimes wonâ€™t need to see the picture exactly and can instead use my knowledge to figure out were the wire will go only then, I wil lbe better at the work.</td>
