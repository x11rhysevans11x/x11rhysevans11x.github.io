    <td>As my partner and I struggled with the flashing lights we had to ask a teacher as we had tried everything we thought would work and it didn't work. But once we asked the teacher he should us how to do it and we got through the first exercise.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to learn how to code better and learn what the code means to make the work easier so my partner and I work faster so we can get onto new things and explore the world of the FUZE boxes more and make it more fun for us to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work faster and more effectively so that I stay at a good working pace not too fast and not too slow, I need to find the median of fast and slow and I will find that by learning more about the FUZE boxes via research after school. As I did today to learn more about it’s 'breadboard’ and how it works.</td>
