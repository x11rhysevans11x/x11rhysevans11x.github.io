ADVERTS AND MEDIA BLOG POST

During my I.t on the thirteenth of January 2016 we were doing various things first we played bingo but instead of using numbers we used ns such as: can you access the internet whenever you want? (which is no as you can't when you are at school) and then we watched a Kia advert which somehow linked some unfit hamsters that became fit to Kia making a new design. after the hamster's got in shape they turned up to a red carpet event in a green Kia (not what I would choose honestly.)Then for homework we had to answer these 3 questions: Who is the target audience?What is the subtext in this media example?What are the untold stories? My advert I chose was Star Wars the force awakens 2nd teaser.
