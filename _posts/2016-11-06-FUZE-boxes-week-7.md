    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by working openly to get more ideas.Sometimes my partner and I asked classmates near or next to us what they did to give us our own ideas meaning that we worked faster than without their help. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I didn't trust ideas of others or my partner as I thought they were wrong. So sometimes I need to be more reasonable when making a decision and not just make it myself but use other people to help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my outlook on other people's ideas. This will improve my learning as I will have more ideas when me or my partner are stuck and that means we have a better chance of reaching the solution to the problem.  </td>
  </tr>
