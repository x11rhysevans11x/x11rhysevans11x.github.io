My repl.it work

In my I.T lesson on wednesday we were working on a new and very confusing topic, procedures, this was very complicated but Mr Keen simplified the work as much as possible to make sure we understood the topic fully.

Also we were showed how to put a repl.it work into our blogs. Here is mine:

I found the lesson challenging but also interesting, especially the part Mr Keen showed s what random really is via a quick round of bckgammon
