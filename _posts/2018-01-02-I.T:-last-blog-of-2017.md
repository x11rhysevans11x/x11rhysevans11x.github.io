I.T: last blog of 2017

After a long year this is my final blog before the end of the Christmas term, I feel that I have achieved a lot over this year but I still have much to improve.

 For example I am still pretty bad at making sure to use white space when necessary or just simply doing my blog earlier than I have this year, as I sometimes struggle to remember as much as possible. So my New Year's resolution is to do my I.T homework the day I get it and learn more about code.
