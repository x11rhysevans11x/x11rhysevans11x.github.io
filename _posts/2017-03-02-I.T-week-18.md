    <td>During this lesson I learned mostly the same as I always do. Try to work fast but not too fast so I could get as much work done as possibly, read the instructions carefully so that I don't get the exercise wrong, this was effective as I never spent too much time on a single exercise and therefore learnt more.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today I got a bit distracted, talking when I shouldn’t of been which therefore annoyed Mr. Keen which I can completely understand but after this I knuckled down and got more work done. So I need to work on not getting distracted by others and instead concentrate on my own work.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So next time I won’t talk as much and will work faster, I will work at a similar speed as today I finished half of functions to complete it, then all of taking a vacation as well. So I will improve my learning by not getting distracted from my work and I will try and get even more work done in the lesson as well as homework time.</td>
