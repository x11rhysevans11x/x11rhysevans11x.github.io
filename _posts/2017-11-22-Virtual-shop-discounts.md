Virtual shop discounts

In our last lesson we learnt how add discounts to our shops. By this I mean, for example, buy 5 or more items and get 15 percent off. 

This required us again to use the VLOOKUP tool as well as the SUM tool I found this difficult at times as I wasn't sure which cells I was meant to include my code in at first but then with a few looks at the board I learnt how to complete the work efficiently and even had a few minutes at the end to add some pictures to my spreadsheet
