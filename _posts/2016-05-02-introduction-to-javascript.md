Introduction to javascript

During my I.T lesson today we continued to study micro:bit.

We followed a tutorial on how to make a sorting hat (a randomiser) on touchdevelop, touchdevelop in my opinion is the easier way to code on micro:bit, we followed the tutorials and got the finished result of a working randomiser.

After we finished the tutorial we had to complete a worksheet on google classroom about certain blocks of code such as: input--->on button pressed (A) you would then say what that block did when activated.

However before all of this we watched the actual sorting hat scene from Harry Potter so that me and everyone who didn't know what it was could know what we were going to make.

We were then set our homework which was to make another randomiser but this time on javascript; after this we left for breaktime
