  <tr>
    <td> As I wasn't in the lesson I wasn’t able to ask people around me for advice if I was stuck so I had to browse the internet in some cases to find stuff out. In a way not having anyone around was a good thing as I couldn’t get distracted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I couldn’t ask people around me for help I worked slower and got stuck more often, therefore making my progress and how much I got done more limited. So I need to work on being more independent when I work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well hopefully I’ll be in the next lesson which will mean I will be able to catch up easier and work more effectively. That will improve my learning as I will get more done and then learn more advanced parts of Python.</td>
  </tr>
