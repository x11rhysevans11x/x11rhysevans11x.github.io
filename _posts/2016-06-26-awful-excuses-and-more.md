Awful excuses and more!

We started this lesson on a hysterical note with some boy's not being able to complete the most basic of homework and then to make matters worse they began launching excuses at Mr Keen which didn’t help their cause…

Now onto the work me and my group had been struggling for a long time trying to make our game work we kept persevering to make it work but we just kept tripping up. This was quite upsetting as we just couldn't do it but the at the end of the lesson Mr Keen sent us over to Nik who had cracked the code for movement and he gave us some advice. This made us walk away on a high and happy note.
