Slow but steady FUZE box

In this lesson I definitely wasn't very fast but I took it steady to make sure I got it right. It is good that I can work at different speeds however, to get more work done you have to be fast and accurate at the same time.

Today my partner and I got 2 exercises done and I am certain we got them right I for one would rather get 2 exercises spot on rather than doing 5 get fifty percent of them wrong.

I do need to work on my speed of work I am accurate but speed is somewhat key to doing things not just with the FUZE boxes but  also just in life.
