  <tr>
    <td>Today I was reliant on previous work to help me through the exercises as I found them very challenging. This was effective as it refreshed me on stuff I had done but forgot during doing other stuff so whn I remembered how to do something I could add it to my solution of the work and if I was wrong I could recap something else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I found the exercises were so difficult, it slowed me down a lot and meant I couldn't get onto different work this was probably to do with me missing something in the instructions. So I need to work on reading the instructions more thoroughly and making sure I don’t miss anything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So next time I will read the instructions more carefully and will go back through other exercises like I did today. This will improve my learning as I won’t have to spend so long on one exercise and will instead be able to do it in a lot less time and get onto different work and chapters.</td>
