  <tr>
    <td>Today I learnt by finding out what mr. Keen had done and then putting it in my own work and the parts he didn't show us how to do I used trial and error and my python knowledge. This was effective as it meant I worked fast for the time I had.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>However as we were shown stuff and we discussed things it mean we didn't have much term at our computers, however I would’ve been very stuck without it. I need to work on my eye for detail when I code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although there won’t be a 'next time’ in year 8 my knowledge of python will have increased massively via lots of regular at coding. If I practise enough I will have a big jumpstart for next year’s work. </td>
