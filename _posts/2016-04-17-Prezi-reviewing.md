Prezi reviewing

Today we started our lesson by going to the front to review who had handed in their prezi's correctly, However before we did this Mr Keen showed us the comments on the google classroom stream on the comments Charlie asked Mr Keen 6! Yes 6 questions which let's say Mr Keen didn’t like much…

We then looked at Eshen's prezi which wasn’t very good as he had put his work all over the screen and in quite a weird version of 'chronological’ order… 

Mr Keen then gave us our task for the lesson which was to review a friend's website the categories for this were: colour of web page and text, icon, layout, amount of blogs, length of blogs, the quality of the posts and the all important spelling and grammar of our posts.

We also had to give 3 pieces of advice for our partner to improve his blog; then Mr Keen gave us our homework and then we left for break time.

Also I forgot to mention almost half the class lost their breaktime as they had handed in their prezi's incorrectly!
