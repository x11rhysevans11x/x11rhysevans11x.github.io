  <tr>
    <td>Today I learnt by staying completely focused on my own work and used the glossary instead of asking others unless I really had to ask someone this helped as I wasn't slowing others down and then possibly not knowing anything more than I had knew when I asked but instead used the glossary and most of the time had the answer easier.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>However as I didn’t ask people for advice as much it meant I would sometimes use the glossary too much and not get anywhere off it , but if I asked someone for advice I would’ve understood it better and then could’ve done the exercise in a shorter amount of time . So I need to work on balancing asking people and using the glossary.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will read the instructions better so that I get more done and I will also use other people's opinions and advice to enhance my progress but will also use resources from the programme as well to help and I will balance them out to make me work more efficiently and therefore learn more information from it. </td>
