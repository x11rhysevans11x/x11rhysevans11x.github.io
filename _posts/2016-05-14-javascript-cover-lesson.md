Java script cover lesson

At the start of our I.T lesson on the 11th of May we found out the news that Mr Keen was absent today so we had a cover teacher, again in the form of Miss Collis.

So onto what we did in the lesson, we were again on microbit javascript finishing all the tutorials on the program with the help of the microbit cookbook. I tried to do all the tutorials and I did apart from the last one which I couldn't complete before the lesson but I was still proud of all the work I did.

So at the end of the lesson we weren't set any homework to the classes delight and we then left for break...
